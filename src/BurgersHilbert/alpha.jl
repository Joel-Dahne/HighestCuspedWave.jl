    alpha0(u0::BHAnsatz; M::Integer, rtol, verbose)

Enclose the value of `α₀`, given by the maximum of `u0.w(x) / 2u0(x)`
on ``[0, π]``.

It uses an asymptotic expansion with `M` terms close to zero and ball
arithmetic on the remaining.

In practice the maximum is attained at `x = π` so the function is
evaluated there first. Then starting at `ϵ = 1 / 2` we halve `ϵ` until
the bound at `x = ϵ` using the asymptotic evaluation is smaller than
the value at `π`. We the prove that the value on ``[0, ϵ]`` is bounded
by the value at `x = π` using [`bounded_by`](@ref).

On the interval `[ϵ, π]` we bound it using ball arithmetic with
[`ArbExtras.maximum_enclosure`](@ref). Notice that we do not have to
prove that the maximum is attained at `x = π`, it's only used to make
the procedure more efficient.

# Arguments
- `M::Integer = 3`: Determines the number of terms used for the asymptotic
  expansion.
- `rtol = 1e-5`: Determines the relative tolerance used on the interval ``[ϵ,
  π]``.
- `degree::Integer = 0`: Degree to use in
  [`ArbExtras.maximum_enclosure`](@ref), in practice `degree = 0` is
  enough to pick up monotonicity of the function.
- `return_details::Bool = false`: If true it returns some more details
  about the computations. It returns the value that was used for `ϵ`.
- `verbose::Bool = false`: If true it prints more information about
  the process.
