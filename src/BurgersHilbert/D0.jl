    D0_bound(u0::BHAnsatz; atol = 1e-3, verbose = false)

Upper bound the value of `D₀` from the paper.

The interval `[0, π]` is split into two parts, `[0, ϵ]` and ´[ϵ, π]`.
On `[0 ϵ]` we use an asymptotic expansion of `T0(u0)` whereas on ´[ϵ,
π]` we use a non-asymptotic version.

In practice the maximum is attained on `[ϵ, π]` and for that reason we
compute the maximum on this part first and then only prove that the
value on `[0, ϵ]` is bounded by this value.

For the non-asymptotic version we do a number of optimizations for
performance reasons.

The first optimization is to notice that even though `T0(u0)` doesn't
support evaluation on `ArbSeries`, and hence we can't use higher order
methods, `u0` does. We can thus get a much tighter enclosure of `u0`
by enclosing it with [`ArbExtras.enclosure_series`](@ref).

The second optimization comes from noticing that the enclosure for
`u0` that we get using the above strategy means that we get a much
tighter enclosure for `u0` than for `T0(u0)`. This means that we have
to split a lot to get good bounds for `T0(u0)` but not nearly as much
to get good bounds for `u0`. We therefore [`mince`](@ref) the interval
into several smaller pieces on which we evaluate `T0(u0)` and then put
the result together. While this doesn't decrease the number of times
we have to evaluate `T0(u0)` (in fact it probably increases it), it
does decrease the number of times we have to evaluate `u0`, which
turns out to be the more costly part of the procedure.
